# Fullstack Open Projects

This repository contains the projects completed during the **Fullstack Open** course. It covers technologies such as **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, **GraphQL**, **TypeScript**, **React Native**, **CI/CD**, **Containers**, and **Relational Databases**. Each part corresponds to a project or set of projects that explore different aspects of fullstack development. I will be adding projects progressively as I complete them.
