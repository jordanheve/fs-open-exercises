# Fullstack Open - Part 0.4: New Note

In this section, we will explore how the **New Note** feature works in a web application. The user interacts with the app to create a new note, and the app communicates with the server to fetch necessary data and render it dynamically.

## Sequence Diagram of Fetching Notes

The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of requests and responses between the browser and the server when fetching notes. The browser makes several requests for resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON), and the server responds with the required files. The JavaScript executed by the browser processes the data and renders the notes.

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2025-05-13" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes
