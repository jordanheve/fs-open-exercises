# Fullstack Open - Part 0.5: Single Page App

In this section, we will explore how a **Single Page Application (SPA)** works. A Single Page Application loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the page as the user interacts with the app, without reloading the entire page.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how an SPA interacts with the server to load necessary resources and render dynamic content.
